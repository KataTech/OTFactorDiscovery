# OTFactorDiscovery
AM-SURE 2023 Project for Optimal Transport Factor Discovery | Daniel Wang, Kai M. Hung

### Brief Description 
This repository is a collection of two projects motivated by the usage of optimal transport for factor discovery. 

One project is led by Kai M. Hung with a focus on variability reduction via optimal transport. Variability reduction is at the core of factor discovery, since the removal of a factor that maximally reduces variability can be reveal the factor that maximally influences the distribution for some data of interest. Here, we also link to the corresponding [report](https://math.nyu.edu/media/math/filer_public/51/b1/51b198de-3072-4c10-b729-96111bbc661c/varreduceot.pdf) and [slides](https://math.nyu.edu/media/math/filer_public/07/0c/070c1104-9061-4b11-bd0a-ae7ebc50d48d/variability_reduction_with_optimal_transport.pdf).

Another project is led by Daniel Wang with a focus on exploring generalized K-Means with respect to different distance metrics.
