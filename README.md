AM-SURE 2023 Project: Optimal Transport for Factor Discovery | Daniel J. King, Kai M. Hung

### Brief Description 
This repository is a collection of two projects motivated by the usage of optimal transport for factor discovery. 

One project is led by Kai M. Hung with a focus on variability reduction via optimal transport. Variability reduction is at the core of factor discovery, since the removal of a factor that maximally reduces variability can be reveal the factor that maximally influences the distribution for some data of interest. Here, we also link to the corresponding [report](https://math.nyu.edu/media/math/filer_public/51/b1/51b198de-3072-4c10-b729-96111bbc661c/varreduceot.pdf) and [slides](https://math.nyu.edu/media/math/filer_public/07/0c/070c1104-9061-4b11-bd0a-ae7ebc50d48d/variability_reduction_with_optimal_transport.pdf).

Another project is led by Daniel J. King and investigates variants of k-Means clustering using general costs. In the case of a categorical-valued factor, factor discovery becomes a clustering problem. Taking the lense of optimal transport yields variations on k-Means that incorporate new transport costs and initialization schemes. Here, we again link to the corresponding [report](https://math.nyu.edu/media/math/filer_public/48/72/48728e1e-4bf3-4198-88c4-92ad56ac73cd/am_sure_5.pdf) and [slides](https://math.nyu.edu/media/math/filer_public/19/94/19947867-f928-4bdd-b2ec-4a97cd1f566a/final_presentation_clustering.pdf).
